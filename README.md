# Covid-19
Data visualization on covid-19 

Within months, COVID-19 went from an epidemic to a pandemic. From the first identified case in December 2019,
how did the virus spread so fast and widely? In this free R project, we will visualize data from the early months 
of the coronavirus outbreak to see how this virus grew to be a global pandemic.This project assumes you can manipulate
data frames using dplyr and make plots using ggplot2. You can learn these skills in the courses: Data manipulation with
dplyr and Intermediate Data Visualization with ggplot2.
